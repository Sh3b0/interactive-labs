# Lab Environment

Hello there!

If you're seeing this description with a live terminal on the right, you've successfully started the lab environment.

**Set a username to get started!**

We've prepared a terminal environemnt for you to learn and experiment.

- It's based on an unminimized Ubuntu 24.04 docker container
- It has direct access to your host's networking capabilities
- It's preconfigured with an opinionated setup and a set of tools

Commands you write here are being recorded with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).

- Once you `exit` the terminal (Ctrl+D), the recording can be uploaded to your channel, so make sure you create an account to keep the recording available.

If you prefer to use your host's environment, simply install an ssh server on your host (e.g., `sudo apt install openssh-server`) then connect to it from our terminal like `ssh <USER>@localhost`

This terminal environment uses [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/documentation/) v0.43.1

- Session information are shown in terminal header and shortcuts are shown in the footer.
- Only a single terminal session can be active at a time.
- Sessions *should* survive a browser restart, but not a host reboot.
- Zellij config file is available at `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl` in case you want to customize the terminal looks or behavior
- Hold-down `shift` key while mouse-highlighting text you wish to copy.
