# Symmetric Key Cryptography

Alice and Bob can use a [symmetric key algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm), in which a secret **key** is used to encrypt and decrypt data so Eve cannot make sense of it.

- Think of the algorithm as two functions, thier implementation details are public, but security lies in the key.

  ```
  encrypt(plaintext, key) = ciphertext
  decrypt(ciphertext, key) = plaintext
  ```

In fact, `XOR` works great as an encyption/decryption function [[why?](https://ctf101.org/cryptography/what-is-xor/)]

- Create a script `xor.py`

   ```workshop:copy
   prefix: Python Script
   title: Click to copy
   text: |
      data = 'CAPTURETHEFLAG'
      key = 'A'
      
      encrypted = ''.join([chr(ord(x) ^ ord(key)) for x in data])
      print(f"Encrypted Message: {encrypted.encode()}")
      
      decrypted = ''.join([chr(ord(x) ^ ord(key)) for x in encrypted])
      print(f"Decrypted Message: {decrypted}")
   ```

- Run the script

   ```terminal:execute
   prefix: Command
   title: Click to execute in highlighted terminal
   command: python3 xor.py
   ```

## Exercise 2

A 1-bit key is obviously not secure, prove it by extending the code above to decrypt the `encrypted` text without knowledge of the key used.
